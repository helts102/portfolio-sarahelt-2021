              <h5>UX &amp; web design class project - mobile, tablet & desktop</h5>
              <p>This class project was centered around UX and web design. The goal was to highlight photos of Yolanda’s work, encourage site visitors to pre-order them and convey her mission of using fair-trade materials. The type of person that Yolanda would be attracting is those with a keen eye for interior design who would be drawn to her for her sustainable and fair trade chairs. The way the header text and hero photo are designed intends to draw in site visitors that would match Yolanda’s mission.</p>

              <h5>HTML 5 &amp; CSS Exercise</h5>
              <p>This was a Skillcrush class project which helped me flex my newly learned HTML 5 & CSS skills by creating recipe cards. I used HTML for all of the text and image elements and then used CSS to make these cards take shape and look appealing to the eye. A few key CSS properties and indicators I used were unordered/ordered lists, creating borders and padding for elements like the cook times, block and inline elements and classes to change the titles to be uniform, red and capitalized. This project was challenging and fun to be a part of. </p>

              <h5>HTML5 & CSS Project</h5>
              <p>This was also a class project in which I used HTML 5 & CSS to design a vision board for 2021 and the goals & achievements I would like to make. The design itself was created by someone at Skillcrush. However, I coded all of the HTML 5 and CSS and customized the content and images to suit my goals for 2021. This project taught me to use block elements and to use classes to style the text used across all of the blocks since it is mostly uniform. I also learned to use the span tag in HTML to change certain parts of elements. </p>

            <p>Thank you for visiting my first webpage! I now reside in Boise, Idaho but have roots in Colorado where I went to University of Colorado, Boulder, and grew up in California and Massachusetts.</p>
            <p>My journey to web design and HTML &amp; CSS started during my career in customer relations in the travel industry. I love working with people, I found that I wanted to use my empathy and problem solving skills in a different way and explore creative work with real-time results. I was inspired by my (seemingly far in the past) high school years when my favorite class was AP Art. Thinking about the future now, I plan to convert my artistic skills and passions web design and front end development.</p>
            <p>I found Skillcrush, a self-paced online educational platform to assist in my education, which has greatly assisted in opening this door for a career shift into tech!</p>
